Victor Agostinelli is a PhD candidate in the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/EECS) at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/), advised by [Lizhong Chen](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~chenliz/). His research interests cover the intersection between efficient deep learning architectures and the design of custom hardware to accelerate those architectures in the form of software and hardware (SW/HW) co-design.

Previously, Victor earned his Bachelor of Science degree from Oregon State University in 2020 and his Master of Science degree from Oregon State University in 2023. Currently, he actively collaborates with [Antonino Tumeo](https://www.pnnl.gov/people/antonino-tumeo) at [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov/) as part of the Distinguished Graduate Research Program to improve upon the optimization of specialized hardware for artificial intelligence.
